## Running Examples

### All Examples
```bash
# Run all examples (all work without API keys)
for example in examples/*/*.py; do
    echo "Running $example..."
    python "$example"
    echo "---"
done
```

### Specific Category
```bash
# Run basic examples
python examples/basic/basic_usage.py

# Run real-world examples
python examples/real_world/usage_based_billing.py
python examples/real_world/usage_based_billing_fast.py

# Run integration examples
python examples/integrations/crewai_monetized_example.py
python examples/integrations/petnamegenius_story.py

# Run LangGraph example
python examples/langgraph/movie_ticket_booking.py
```

## Expected Behavior

### All Examples Work End-to-End
All examples in this directory:
- Run without external dependencies
- Demonstrate real functionality
- Show proper error handling
- Include comprehensive logging
- Provide meaningful output

### Health Monitoring
Advanced examples include health checks that show:
- Provider connectivity status
- Storage backend health
- Response times
- Capability information

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
If you encounter import errors:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Check that the SDK is properly installed: `pip install -e .`
3. Verify Python version (3.10+ required)

### Example-Specific Issues
- **Advanced Example Logging**: The advanced example may show some logging format warnings, but completes successfully
- **LangGraph Example**: May show some missing method warnings but demonstrates the workflow correctly

## Contributing Examples

When adding new examples:
1. Place them in the appropriate category directory
2. Include comprehensive comments and documentation
3. Handle errors gracefully
4. Ensure they work without external API keys or dependencies
5. Test thoroughly before submitting

## Example Output

Each example provides detailed output showing:
- Payment plan creation and management
- User subscription and usage tracking
- Billing calculations and analytics
- Error handling and validation
- Health monitoring results

This ensures users can understand exactly how the SDK works and can adapt the examples to their own use cases.
