### Code Style Guidelines

#### Python Code Style

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with some modifications:

```python
# ‚úÖ Good
def process_payment(amount: int, currency: str) -> PaymentResult:
    """Process a payment with the given amount and currency.
    
    Args:
        amount: Payment amount in cents
        currency: Three-letter currency code
        
    Returns:
        PaymentResult object with payment details
        
    Raises:
        PaymentError: If payment processing fails
    """
    if amount <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Amount must be positive")
    
    return PaymentResult(
        payment_id="pi_123",
        status="succeeded",
        amount=amount
    )

# ‚ùå Bad
def processPayment(amount,currency):
    if amount<=0:raise ValueError("Amount must be positive")
    return PaymentResult(payment_id="pi_123",status="succeeded",amount=amount)
```

#### Import Organization

```python
# Standard library imports
import os
import sys
from typing import Optional, List

# Third-party imports
import requests
import stripe

# Local imports
from aiagent_payments.core import PaymentProcessor
from aiagent_payments.exceptions import PaymentError
```

#### Type Hints

Always use type hints for function parameters and return values:

```python
from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any

def create_customer(
    email: str,
    name: Optional[str] = None,
    metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> Customer:
    """Create a new customer."""
    pass
```

### Testing Guidelines

#### Test Structure

```python
import pytest
from aiagent_payments import PaymentProcessor

class TestPaymentProcessor:
    """Test cases for PaymentProcessor."""
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def processor(self):
        """Create a test processor instance."""
        return PaymentProcessor(provider="mock")
    
    def test_process_payment_success(self, processor):
        """Test successful payment processing."""
        result = processor.process_payment(
            amount=1000,
            currency="usd",
            description="Test payment"
        )
        
        assert result.status == "succeeded"
        assert result.amount == 1000
        assert result.currency == "usd"
    
    def test_process_payment_invalid_amount(self, processor):
        """Test payment with invalid amount."""
        with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Amount must be positive"):
            processor.process_payment(
                amount=-100,
                currency="usd",
                description="Test payment"
            )
```

#### Test Coverage

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration tests**: Test interactions between components
- **Functional tests**: Test complete workflows
- **Edge cases**: Test error conditions and boundary values

### Documentation Guidelines

#### Docstrings

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def process_payment(
    amount: int,
    currency: str,
    description: str,
    metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> PaymentResult:
    """Process a payment with the specified parameters.
    
    Args:
        amount: Payment amount in cents (e.g., 1000 for $10.00)
        currency: Three-letter currency code (e.g., "usd", "eur")
        description: Human-readable description of the payment
        metadata: Optional metadata to attach to the payment
        
    Returns:
        PaymentResult object containing payment details
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If amount is negative or currency is invalid
        PaymentError: If payment processing fails
        
    Example:
        >>> processor = PaymentProcessor(provider="stripe")
        >>> result = processor.process_payment(1000, "usd", "Test payment")
        >>> print(result.status)
        'succeeded'
    """
    pass
```

#### README Updates

When adding new features, update relevant documentation:

- **Main README**: Add overview of new features
- **Examples**: Add working examples
- **API documentation**: Update docstrings
- **Wiki**: Update relevant wiki pages

## üß™ Testing

    pass

def test_process_payment_raises_error_for_negative_amount():
    pass

def test_customer_creation_with_optional_fields():
    pass

# ‚ùå Bad test names
def test_payment():
    pass

def test_error():
    pass
```

#### Test Organization

```python
class TestPaymentProcessor:
    """Test PaymentProcessor functionality."""
    
    class TestProcessPayment:
        """Test payment processing methods."""
        
        def test_successful_payment(self):
            """Test successful payment processing."""
            pass
        
        def test_failed_payment(self):
            """Test failed payment processing."""
            pass
    
    class TestCustomerManagement:
        """Test customer management methods."""
        
        def test_create_customer(self):
            """Test customer creation."""
            pass
        
        def test_update_customer(self):
            """Test customer updates."""
            pass
```
